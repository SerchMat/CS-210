Projet Three or Grocer Corner is a grocery tracker application that displays a list of items bought during the day. Grocer Corner program has 4 option 
1) Display the frequency of all items
2) Display the frequency of a specific item
3) Histogram
4) Exit

Grocer Corner is a combination of two languages (C++ and Python) on which we show the development and efficiency of both working together. Grocer Corner uses Python to process the data and C++ to read files and interact with the user. In the connection of the functions from Python to the C++ code, I did particular well since we use basic loops and previous connections on past projects

Grocer Corner project could be a challenging project since It could be the first time for some developers to use two languages at the same time. In my personal experience Displaying the frequency of certain objects was the most challenging part of the project since we have to use two loops to search for that specific item. The help of the professor did help me to understand how I solve this problem. 

Grocer Corner will help developers to understand and implement the use of more than one language to create a program. It's a good practice to develop problem-solving skills since it could be confusing how languages will interact or what is the proper function to use.

The code is easy to understand for other developers since I used easy names on the functions so developers can identify the function of them, also I wrote a lot of comments which allow the developers to have more information about the function and how they work.
